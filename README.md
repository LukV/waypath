## üß™ Development

### Coding Standards & Pre-commit

Use ruff and mypy for code quality.

```bash
make lint       # Ruff lint
make format     # Ruff format
make typecheck  # Mypy strict checks
```

Use  [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) via:

```bash
make commit
```

Run checks before committing:

```bash
uv run --link-mode=copy pre-commit run --all-files
```

### Git Workflow

#### Branch Strategy
- `main`: The only long-lived branch.
- `feature/*`: For new features.
- `fix/*`: For bugfixes.

#### Typical Flow

```bash
git checkout main
git pull origin main
git checkout -b feature/my-change
# Make changes
git add .
uv run --link-mode=copy pre-commit run --all-files
make commit
git push origin feature/my-change
```

Then open a Pull Request into main.

### Versioning & Releases

We use **semantic versioning** powered by `commitizen`.

Semantic Versioning Format
